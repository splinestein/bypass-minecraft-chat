# FreedomOfSpeech plugin
## Bypass the pesky new report & chat preview features

* Requirements: LuckPerms

Uses LuckPerms API alongside my plugin to collect prefix data.
Chat messages are stopped and sent through to the server before validation.
This renders the report mechanic useless and no need to wait for chat security validation.
